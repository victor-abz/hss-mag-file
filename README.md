# Electron JS x Python Fast API

> Modern web UI x Python FAST API

## Preview

![Fast API Electron JS Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoviawan/fast-api-electron-js/main/public/assets/media/logo/python-electronjs.gif)

## Prerequisite

-   Working Python environment (virtual environment is recommended), Python 3
-   Know how to use Node.js command

## Features

1.  Python Backend - do as you wish with python, do AI / ML / etc and send those data to modern web UI
2.  Cross Platform APP using web UI

## Installing / Getting started

clone this git

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gnoviawan/fast-api-electron-js.git
```

## Initial Configuration

change directory to cloned git

```shell
cd fast-api-electron-js
```

install all python dependencies

```shell
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
npm run py-install
```

install all node js dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

## Developing

#### Directory Structure :

`engine/` : a python directory for Fast API, create/modify all python module there, keep the `api.py` file name if you want to easily building the app later.

`public/`: all frontend related files

`public/assets/js/python.js`: is responsible to communicate between our frontend and backend.

`public/assets/js/main.js`: electron main window

#### Preview your Application :

run this command to preview your app

```shell
npm run electron-dev
```

## Deploying / Publishing

#### Building Python :

before we building our app we have to build our Python FastAPI to .exe file ( windows ) or other executable format for each OS using PyInstaller and then call our Python Fast api as a child process inside electron js.

run this command to build python using `PyInstaller` library

please adjust the `api.spec` if you want to modify the build process or icon, please refer to the [PyInstaller documentation](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec-files.html)

```shell
npm run py-build
```

also if you are not using Windows change this code inside `public/assets/js/main.js` to another OS executable format ( not tested )

```javascript
const API_PROD_PATH = path.join(process.resourcesPath, '../lib/api/api.exe');
```

#### Build the application :

after we build our fast API it's time to build our main APP, run this command to build it

```shell
npm run electron-build
```

our app are published to this path `dist`
if you want to change the build options modify this config file `electron-builder.config.json` more about the options please check [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) documentation
